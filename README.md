# Convoluted Chat Site

## Idea
Let's make a chat site that doesn't use websockets, but also doesn't use long/short polling.
Alright. How? 
What if we have a SSE endpoint to get messages and HTTP API to send messages? 
Kinda like Pub/Sub.
Well, that's convoluted. ...And gives rise to unecessary problems.
So let's make unecessary solutions.

## Architecture/Flow
Yet to do.
